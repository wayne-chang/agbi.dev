# AGBI: Artificial General Business Intelligence

## What is AGBI?
AGBI refers to AI systems that can understand and operate businesses at a human or superhuman level, automating high-level functions like strategy, management, innovation, and decision making, while working with a full, AI-to-AI, complete end-to-end stack. The goal is to create AI that can ideate, build, market, and grow businesses without human intervention, enabling the rise of zero-humans companies.

## Why AGBI Matters
AGBI has the potential to revolutionize business. It can help companies operate more efficiently, innovate faster, and scale rapidly. This could lead to zero-humans companies – venture-scale startups that operate entirely autonomously.

### AI-to-AI vs. Human-to-AI Approaches
Most companies today are taking a Human-to-AI approach, where AI augments and assists human workers. This approach can lead to incremental improvements in efficiency and productivity, but it's fundamentally limited by the constraints of human cognition and the legacy systems and processes that companies have in place.

In contrast, an AI-to-AI approach to AGBI would start from a clean slate. There would be no legacy information, no legacy processes, and no legacy humans to contend with. The AI would be free to design and optimize every aspect of the business from the ground up, based on real-world data and results.

This AI-to-AI approach would allow for rapid iteration and improvement, as the AI continuously learns and adapts to drive towards the most optimal outcomes. It would also enable the creation of services that are naturally welcoming to AGBI, as they would be designed from the start to interface with and leverage AI capabilities.

This is a fundamentally different approach than the Human-to-AI model, and it's one that has the potential to unlock far greater value and innovation. But it also requires a willingness to let go of the past and embrace a radically different future.

AGBI will fundamentally change the nature of competition. In a world where businesses can be run by AI, the key differentiator will be the quality of the data and algorithms, not the size of the workforce or the experience of the management team. This means that small, agile teams with access to unique data and cutting-edge AI will be able to compete with established giants.

The impact of AGBI and the zero-humans company will differ for businesses with high people count versus those with low or zero people count:

| Aspect                   | High People Count Businesses                                          | Zero-Humans Businesses                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Competitive Advantage    | Slow to adopt AGBI, gradual efficiency gains                          | Early adopters of AGBI, rapid growth and innovation             |
| Organizational Structure | Hierarchical, many layers of management                               | Flat, decentralized, autonomous                                 |
| Costs                    | High labor costs, office space, benefits                              | Minimal labor costs, no physical office necessary               |
| Scalability              | Constrained by hiring, training, and managing people                  | Highly scalable, can expand rapidly without adding staff        |
| Agility                  | Slow to change, bound by human decision-making                        | Highly adaptable, can pivot quickly based on AI insights        |
| Culture                  | Defined by human interaction, potential for conflict and misalignment | Defined by AI alignment, potential for goal-oriented efficiency |

## The Path to AGBI
Building AGBI is a complex challenge that requires advances in AI and business understanding. Here's our approach:

1. **Data Collection and Integration**: We're building a comprehensive list of business tools with API hooks for accessing unique, business-specific data. This data will fuel our AGBI systems, providing the raw material for understanding and analyzing business environments. Crucially, each company will own and control its own data – security and privacy are our highest priorities. We're also leveraging and interfacing with existing AI systems, such as Sendgrid AI for email marketing, Mailchimp AI for customer engagement, and various financial AI for accounting and forecasting. By integrating with these specialized AI services, we can accelerate our development and focus on the core challenges of AGBI.

2. **Business Strategy and Planning Engine**: We're building the core of our AGBI system – an engine that can analyze data, generate insights, evaluate actions, plan for the future, and make autonomous decisions. This requires expertise in machine learning, decision theory, game theory, optimization, and strategic planning. The engine will continuously assess the business environment, identify opportunities and threats, and devise strategies to achieve the company's goals.

3. **Decision Execution Engine**: Once the Business Strategy and Planning Engine has made a decision, the Decision Execution Engine takes over. This engine is responsible for translating the high-level strategy into a series of actionable steps and ensuring that these steps are carried out efficiently and effectively. It will coordinate the various AI subsystems, allocate resources, and monitor progress to ensure that the decision is implemented successfully.

4. **Business Progress Engine**: The Business Progress Engine continuously runs in the background, synthesizing the latest state of the company across all areas of the business. It aggregates data from the various AI subsystems, monitors key performance indicators, and provides real-time insights into the health and progress of the company. This engine is crucial for enabling the Business Strategy and Planning Engine to make informed decisions based on the most up-to-date information.

5. **Continuous Learning**: AGBI systems need to learn and adapt continuously. We're developing algorithms that can update the system's knowledge and skills in real-time, without forgetting what it's learned before.

The key to AGBI isn't just advanced AI, but also a deep understanding of business. We're bringing together experts in AI, business strategy, and entrepreneurship to create systems that can navigate the complexities of the business world.

The zero-humans company, enabled by AGBI, is not a matter of if, but when. Given the exponential pace of AI technology advancement and the collective efforts of the AGBI.dev community, it could arrive much sooner than we expect. When it does, it will reshape the business world as we know it, creating winners and losers on a scale we've never seen before.

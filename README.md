# AGBI: Artificial General Business Intelligence

## What is AGBI?

AGBI is AI that can automate high-level business functions like strategy, management, and decision making. The goal is to create AI that can ideate, build, market, and grow businesses without human intervention.

## Why AGBI Matters

AGBI has the potential to revolutionize business. It can help companies operate more efficiently, innovate faster, and scale rapidly. This could lead to zero-humans companies – venture-scale startups that operate entirely autonomously.

AGBI will fundamentally change the nature of competition. In a world where businesses can be run by AI, the key differentiator will be the quality of the data and algorithms, not the size of the workforce or the experience of the management team. This means that small, agile teams with access to unique data and cutting-edge AI will be able to compete with established giants.

## The Path to AGBI

Building AGBI is a complex challenge that requires advances in AI and business understanding. Here's our approach:

1. **Data Collection**: We're building a comprehensive list of business tools with API hooks for accessing unique, business-specific data. This data will fuel our AGBI systems, providing the raw material for understanding and analyzing business environments. Crucially, each company will own and control its own data – security and privacy are our highest priorities.

2. **Business Strategy Engine**: We're building the core of our AGBI system – an engine that can analyze data, generate insights, evaluate actions, and make autonomous decisions. This requires expertise in machine learning, decision theory, game theory, and optimization.

3. **Continuous Learning**: AGBI systems need to learn and adapt continuously. We're developing algorithms that can update the system's knowledge and skills in real-time, without forgetting what it's learned before.

4. **Natural Language Interaction**: AGBI needs to communicate with humans and other AI systems. We're advancing natural language processing to enable seamless interaction.

5. **Security and Reliability**: To be trusted to operate autonomously, AGBI needs to be secure and reliable. We're developing robust architectures and advanced verification methods to ensure the safety and integrity of the system.

The key to AGBI isn't just advanced AI, but also a deep understanding of business. We're bringing together experts in AI, business strategy, and entrepreneurship to create systems that can navigate the complexities of the business world.
